Great presentation by [Toby Webb](http://ethicalcorp.blogspot.com/) of [Ethical Corporation](http://www.ethicalcorp.com). Highlights some history and multiple perspectives on corporate responsibility and his preference for tying it to [Evidence Based Management](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_management). Worth reading through.
