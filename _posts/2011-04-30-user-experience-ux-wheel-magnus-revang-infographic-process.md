When I examined Magnus&#8217; detailed expansion of [Peter Morville&#8217;s UX Honeycomb](../ux-user-experience-honeycomb-design-aspects/) into a clockwise process with individual subprocesses, I was delighted to say the least. To me, this represents a complete picture of web and content development, and marketing. Excellent! Click on the image to see the details.

I modified his diagram to give proper credit to his work (in case you see this Magnus!)
